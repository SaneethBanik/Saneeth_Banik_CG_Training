Git has three main states that the files can reside in, modified, staged and comitted
>Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
>Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
>Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

The three main sections of Git:
>The Working Directory which is the current location where all the files are edited and saved by the user. 
 Files are added from this stage to the next stage.
>The Staging Area, it stores the information or files that will be present in the users next commit.
>The Git Directory, this is where git stores the data of the files that have been committed from the staging area.

The process of committing a file to a git repository:
1> Files in the working directory which have to be committed have to be added to the staging area using the command
   git add <filename> :if a specific file has to be added to the staging area or git add . to add all the files in 
   the current directory to the staging area
2> In the staging the files are converted to tracked files from un-tracked files, to commit files into the local,
   repository the command git commit is used it commits all the files in the staging area to the local repository
   here in the local repository all the files are stored in the local system.
3> To add files from the local repository to the remote repository the command git push is used where the files from
   the local repository is pushed to the specified remote repository.

Branching in Git:
$git branch <branch_name>				:to create a new branch 
$git checkout <branch_name>				:to move to the specified branch name
$git merge <branch_name>				:to merge a specified branch to the current directory in 
							 which the user is present
$git rebase						:this command attaches the branch of any directory to the newest update 
							 of the directory 

making changes in a specific commit: git rebase -i HEAD~<number of positions from head>
this operates on the number of positions specified from the head if the number is 2 then will display and will let the user edit 
and make changes to the 2 commits done before the HEAD. It helps in changing wordings and editing of commited files.
